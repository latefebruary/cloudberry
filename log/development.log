Почти каждый день будущие акробаты, жонглеры и фокусники упражняются на трамплинах, брусьях и батутах под присмотром учителя.

Причем не только кинематографического. Показанные в картине события — космические полеты через гиперпространство, падения в черные дыры и путешествия во времени — вызвали бурные дискуссии как среди любителей фантастики, так и в околонаучных кругах. Что неудивительно — консультантом фильма выступил знаменитый физик-теоретик Кип Торн. А там, где дело касается современной теоретической физики, сплошь и рядом получается так, что еще вчера бывшее оголтелой фантастикой сегодня оказывается респектабельной научной теорией.</p><h1>Кротовая нора</h1><p>Основные события фильма начинаются с полета главных героев через развернувшуюся рядом с Сатурном червоточину. Физически она представляет собой тоннель, связывающий две удаленные области пространства-времени. Эти области могут как находиться в одной и той же вселенной, так и связывать разные точки разных вселенных (в рамках концепции <a href=\"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F\">мультивселенной</a>). В зависимости от возможности вернуться сквозь нору обратно их подразделяют на проходимые и непроходимые. Непроходимые дыры быстро закрываются и не дают возможности потенциальному путешественнику проделать обратный путь.</p><p>С математической точки зрения кротовая нора представляет собой гипотетический объект, получаемый как особое несингулярное (конечное и имеющее физический смысл) решение уравнений <a href=\"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8\">общей теории относительности</a> (ОТО) Альберта Эйнштейна. Обычно червоточины изображают в виде согнутой двумерной поверхности. Попасть с одной ее стороны на другую можно, перемещаясь обычным способом.

В наглядном случае двумерного пространства видно, что это позволяет существенно сократить расстояние.</p><p>В двумерии горловины червоточины — отверстия, с которых начинается и заканчивается тоннель, — имеют форму окружности. В трехмерии (как в фильме) горловина кротовой норы похожа на сферу. Образуются такие объекты из двух сингулярностей в разных областях пространства-времени, которые в гиперпространстве (пространстве большей размерности) стягиваются друг к другу с образованием норы.

Лишние вещи создают иллюзию, что у вас много одежды, а отсюда рождается это вечное «нечего надеть».</p><p>Поэтому самостоятельно разбирать свой гардероб пару раз в год и избавляться от лишнего необходимо. Для разбора вам понадобится телефон, чтобы делать фотографии, пустая квартира, чтобы никто не мешал, и бутылка шампанского для задора.

Если нет, перемещайте их в первую категорию. В этой категории у вас точно окажутся вещи, купленные спонтанно. А спонтанность при работе над стилем — зло.

Если они на 100 % выражают вашу индивидуальность и подчёркивают достоинства фигуры, в будущем ищите им аналоги. Фотографируйте разные комплекты, чтобы с утра первым делом не лезть в «Инстаграм», а выбирать образ на день.</p><p>Когда все вещи разложены перед вами, можно оценить масштаб бедствия. Если у вещей нет одного направления, а 60 % одежды вы не носите, значит, у вас нет стиля, а есть просто вещи, которые ничего про вас не говорят.
